# LyreIDE
Lyre IDE is a free and open source IDE designed for and written in C# programming language. It is licensed under GPL 3. Lyre IDE is specifically designed for Linux users in mind. 

# Goal
Our goal in mind is to make a FOSS alternative for C# developers in Linux. Currently the best option for Linux users is JetBrains Rider, which is not a good deal.
Rider costs between 89 to 149$ per year(depending on years of usage). Another option is to use Visual Studio Code, which is not a full IDE. Lastly visual studio on VM is not
performance efficent.
